# Logistic Regression 

In this file, I will train a model using supervised learning. Supervised learning is a process of building a machine learning model that is based on labeled training data. 
Logistic Regression Classifier: 
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, predicting the probability of an outcome belonging to one or more than one classes
Our goal is to find a relationship between the dependent and independent variables by estimating probabilities using the logistic function.

# How can it be used in chemical engineering?
Applications:
1) Predicting Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) in Petrochemical Plants
2) Foiling in Heat Exchangers
3) Classifying Process Stability in Chemical Reactions
4) Quality Control in Product Formulation
