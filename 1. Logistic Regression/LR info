# Logistic Regression 

In this file, I will train a model using supervised learning. Supervised learning is a process of building a machine learning model that is based on labeled training data. 
Logistic Regression Classifier: 
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, predicting the probability of an outcome belonging to one or more than one classes
Our goal is to find a relationship between the dependent and independent variables by estimating probabilities using the logistic function.

# How can it be used in chemical engineering?
Applications:
1) Predicting Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) in Petrochemical Plants
2) Foiling in Heat Exchangers
3) Classifying Process Stability in Chemical Reactions
4) Quality Control in Product Formulation

Code: 
The PNG of code, which is shared in this file, has temperature and pressure values that are plotted on a graph. 
The model used to plot data on the graph uses logistic regression model.

In the code snippet, you just have to enter the data, which is the temperature and pressure, then the model will plot it according to the class you have described.
