This repository, "Integration-of-Machine-Learning-and-Chemical-Engineering," serves as a comprehensive resource for learning the fundamentals of machine learning (ML) with a focus on its applications in chemical engineering. It covers a range of ML models and classifiers, including Naive Bayes Classification, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Principal Component Analysis, Manifold Learning, k-Means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Kernel Density Estimation. Each topic is explored through theoretical explanations, Python code implementations, and practical examples tailored to chemical engineering challenges.

The goal is to bridge the gap between data science and chemical engineering by demonstrating how ML techniques can address real-world problems such as process optimization, predictive maintenance, and material discovery. For instance, regression models can predict reaction yields, clustering algorithms can segment process data, and dimensionality reduction techniques can simplify complex chemical datasets. 
Designed for both beginners in machine learning and chemical engineering professionals, this repository provides a hands-on approach to learning. Users can explore the code, run examples, and adapt the models to their own datasets.
